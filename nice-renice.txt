#Changing nice / renice values for cpu process prioritization.

#find the PID of the process you want to proiritize by using "sudo htop"

Command to change the value, example:
#changes the proirity to a "-15" value giving the process a higher cpu proirty, in this case, my "Plex Media Serv" running in a Docker container.
sudo renice --priority -15 --pid 31041

# the bigger the negative number, the more proiritiy it is given.  

#Value Range: 20 to -20.  The More positive the value, the priorority is lessened.
